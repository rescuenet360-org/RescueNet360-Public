                  Every day, animal welfare teams work to save lives with limited time, limited space, and limited visibility. The people who want to help often exist. The information they need does not always reach them in time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A lost pet report might never connect with the shelter holding that pet. A rescue might never see an urgent animal one county over. A foster coordinator might spend hours matching pets to homes when the right family is already in the network.

                I kept seeing missing dog posts online. Most looked like digital flyers, shared over and over by families who were scared, tired, and hoping someone had seen their pet. One story stayed with me.
              </p>
              <p>
                An elderly dog went missing. Her owner searched relentlessly. I offered to help go door to door. She gently declined. When I asked if I could share her story to help others, she said no. She said sharing it would make it feel final. That moment changed how I saw the problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lost pets are not only a neighborhood problem. They are an information problem. Shelters, rescues, pet owners, and community members all care, but they are often working from different places with different pieces of the story.
              </p>
              <p>
                I built RescueNet360 because pets deserve a better chance, families deserve faster answers, and animal welfare teams deserve infrastructure that supports the work they are already doing.
